# Exercise: Checking the Installation of Geopandas

## Summary

This isn't really a normal exercise: instead, it's a quick demonstration of geopandas that serves as a check that your installation was successful.

## Input Data

There's one input file, **tl_2016_36_place-syracuse.zip**, a Census TIGER/Line shapefile containing a single polygon representing the border of the City of Syracuse.

## Deliverables

There is one deliverable, **geopandas-check.png**, an image showing the city's boundar.

## Instructions

1. Install geopandas following the instructions on the class web page under "Software Packages" and then "Geopandas". The direct URL is [https://wilcoxen.maxwell.insightworks.com/pages/geopandas/](https://wilcoxen.maxwell.insightworks.com/pages/geopandas/). Geopandas is a very powerful module but it's also cutting-edge and can be a little tricky and time-consuming to install. Please follow the directions closely. If anything goes wrong, get in touch right away. Resist the temptation to Google for solutions: in the past that has often made things considerably worse.

1. Once geopandas is installed, run the demo script for the assignment. If all goes well, you'll see the outline of Syracuse. If anything goes wrong, get in touch and let me know what happened.

## Submitting

Once you're happy with everything and have committed all of the changes to your local repository, please push the changes to GitHub. At that point, you're done: you have submitted your answer.
